# Image_protection_in_Social_media

This project involves the implementation and evaluation of a digital watermarking system using Python 3.9 and OpenCV 4.5.3. The system is capable of embedding a PNG watermark image into a host image of various sizes and formats.
This can  watermark a selected image and also detect if the watermark is tampered by a attacker.
